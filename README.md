# Improving Human-AI Interactions with More Accessible Deep Learning

In this tutorial, we train an AI system that understands the intent and the entities involved within the query, lookup or launch the relevant information, and return the appropriate response to the customer in a reasonable amount of time. We leverage the Intel Extension for PyTorch to fine-tune a foundational BertModel from the Hugging Face Transformers library to train and deploy an accurate and quick AI system to predict the Intent and Entities of a user requesting information about airline travel.

### Create Environment
You can setup your environment by running `conda env create -f env.yaml` 

This will pre-install: 
- intel distribution of python
- pytorch
- scikit learn
- intel extension for pytorch
- hugging face transformers

If you would like to learn more about the intel extension for pytorch, I highly recommend reviewing the associated GitHub.io Page: https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-pytorch/
